            <h1>⛷️ The Australian Alps get more snow than the Swiss Alps.</h1>
            <p>🔼 While many people visit Australia for its brilliant beaches and year-round sunshine, the Australian Alps, straddling New South Wales and Victoria, are a mecca for skiing enthusiasts. 
               Snow usually falls between June and September, meaning Australia is the perfect place to get your skiing fix during the northern hemisphere summer.</p>
            <p>🔼 Thredbo and Perisher are two large resorts near Canberra, the latter being the largest ski resort in the southern hemisphere. 
               Blue Cow Mountain is one of the most popular areas, with a vast range of accommodation and runs as well as stunning views across the Alps.</p>

            <h1>🏝️ 90% of Australians live on the coast.</h1>
            <p>⏹️ The large deserts of central Australia mean that the vast majority of the population live on the shores of this enormous country. 
               The large cities of Perth, Sydney and Melbourne are iconic places to visit, with buzzing centres and a multitude of beaches, from the sands of Bondi to the surf of Trigg. 
               Outside of the major hubs, there are hundreds of smaller beach towns where you can appreciate Australia's beautiful coastline.</p>
            <p>⏹️ Australia's island status means that there are thousands of surf towns and beaches to be found, so follow the masses and head to the coast.</p>

            <h1>🌴🦘 Tasmania has the cleanest air in the world</h1>
            <p>⏺️ The island of Tasmania is the ideal spot to experience the great outdoors - with air as clean as Antarctica, around one-third of the state is a national park or World Heritage protected. 
               It is a walkers paradise, with trails and walkways winding over the whole island, where the coastal paths reveal impressive views over Wineglass Bay and the Bay of Fires.</p>

            <p>⏺️ If walking isn't your cup of tea, enjoy kayaking, mountain biking and exploring the island's caves. 
               The wildlife is an extension of the unique animals of Australia, where the Eastern Quoll, now considered extinct on the mainland are commonly sighted in the fertile farmland of Tasmania.</p>
