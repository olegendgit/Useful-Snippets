    <h1>The New VW Golf 7 Gti Review</h1>

      <h2>Volkswagen Golf-7 GTI</h2>
      <p>
        ‚¨úÔ∏è The quintessential hot hatch. Rarely the most exciting, most engaging or best-handling car in its class, but usually the most sophisticated and desirable, 
        the Golf GTI has been around in some form or another since the mid-Seventies, when it was dreamt up by a team of just six blokes working after-hours. 
        It was an instant hit - VW planned to build 5,000 of them, but ended up selling six times that in the space of just one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚¨úÔ∏è If you need the extra practicality that rear doors offer, the five-door GTI can oblige. 
        And you‚Äôre not alone. The five-door model accounts for about 70 per cent of all GTI sales. 
        The GTI is virtually identical to the standard Golf in terms of size, so it's just as practical as the standard car. 
        There's a generous 380-litre boot with an adjustable floor, making it better for luggage than the Ford Focus ST, but it has less cargo capacity than the Honda Civic Type R.

      <h2>WHAT IS IT LIKE TO DRIVE?</h2>
      <p>
        ‚ö™Ô∏è The Mk7 GTI uses the same 2.0-litre petrol engine as literally every other even moderately brisk VW.
        While the Mk7 GTI was certainly quick enough when it was launched five years ago, 
        nowadays when it comes to outright power it‚Äôs some way behind similarly-priced rivals such as the 270bhp-odd Ford Focus ST, Renault Megane RS.
        But despite being down on power, it‚Äôs still quick enough - 0-62mph takes 6.2 seconds and it has a top speed of 155mph. 
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ö™Ô∏è With the rear seats folded flat the load area becomes even more practical ‚Äì it's completely flat and the low lip makes it easy to get things in and out. 
        The rear seats are definitely large enough for most adults and there are plenty of storage cubbies around the cabin.
