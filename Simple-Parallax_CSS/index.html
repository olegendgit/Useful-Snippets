      <h2>Volkswagen Golf-7 GTI</h2>
      <p>
        The quintessential hot hatch. Rarely the most exciting, most engaging or best-handling car in its class, but usually the most sophisticated and desirable, 
        the Golf GTI has been around in some form or another since the mid-Seventies, when it was dreamt up by a team of just six blokes working after-hours. 
        It was an instant hit - VW planned to build 5,000 of them, but ended up selling six times that in the space of just one year.

      <h2>WHAT IS IT LIKE TO DRIVE?</h2>
      <p>
        The Mk7 GTI uses the same 2.0-litre petrol engine as literally every other even moderately brisk VW.
        While the Mk7 GTI was certainly quick enough when it was launched five years ago, 
        nowadays when it comes to outright power it’s some way behind similarly-priced rivals such as the 270bhp-odd Ford Focus ST, Renault Megane RS.
        But despite being down on power, it’s still quick enough - 0-62mph takes 6.2 seconds and it has a top speed of 155mph.
